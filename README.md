# CKD-TransBTS: Clinical Knowledge-Driven Hybrid Transformer with Modality-Correlated Cross-Attention for Brain Tumor Segmentation


## Introduction
This is the source code of our paper **[CKD-TransBTS: Clinical Knowledge-Driven Hybrid Transformer with Modality-Correlated Cross-Attention for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10056308/authors)**, which is implemented based on the code of [Swin-Transfomrer](https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer) and [MONAI](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI).

## Abstract
Brain tumor segmentation (BTS) in magnetic resonance image (MRI) is crucial for brain tumor diagnosis, cancer management and research purposes. With the great success of the ten-year BraTS challenges as well as the advances of CNN and Transformer algorithms, a lot of outstanding BTS models have been proposed to tackle the difficulties of BTS in different technical aspects. However, existing studies hardly consider how to fuse the multi-modality images in a reasonable manner. In this paper, we leverage the clinical knowledge of how radiologists diagnose brain tumors from multiple MRI modalities and propose a clinical knowledge-driven brain tumor segmentation model, called CKD-TransBTS. Instead of directly concatenating all the modalities, we re-organize the input modalities by separating them into two groups according to the imaging principle of MRI. A dual-branch hybrid encoder with the proposed modality-correlated cross-attention block (MCCA) is designed to extract the multi-modality image features. The proposed model inherits the strengths from both Transformer and CNN with the local feature representation ability for precise lesion boundaries and long-range feature extraction for 3D volumetric images. To bridge the gap between Transformer and CNN features, we propose a Trans\&CNN Feature Calibration block~(TCFC) in the decoder. We compare the proposed model with six CNN-based models and six transformer-based models on the BraTS 2021 challenge dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art brain tumor segmentation performance compared with all the competitors.

## Getting Started

- Download the repository.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/sword98/CKD-TransBTS.git
  ```

- Train our method from scratch and test it by:

  - Train

    ```
    python main.py --exp-name "CKD" \
        --device 0 --dataset-folder "dataset/" --batch-size 1 \
        --workers 1 --lr 1e-4 --end-epoch 500 --mode "train"
    ```

  - Inference

    ```
    python main.py --exp-name "CKD" \
        --device 0 --dataset-folder "dataset/" --batch-size 1 \
        --workers 1 --mode "test"
    ```

- Test our model directly by:

  ```
  python main.py --exp-name "CKD_Inference" \
      --device 0 --dataset-folder "dataset/" \
      --batch-size 1 --workers 1 --mode "test"
  ```

To test our method directly, you should download the [checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gQLQzx2g9_BFhI_rpOfDfERLozHX7pOg/view?) and place it in the `"CKD_Inference"` folder under the `"best_model"` folder.
